# Crosshair Customizer 
### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/crosshairCustom/)

Crosshair Customizer provides an interface for creating custom animated crosshairs for video games. It was designed for use in the upcoming game S&Box which will allow VueJs for UI components.

This project was the first thing I made in VueJs so although it is functional right now, there will be an update closer to the launch of S&Box which will have optimizations, new features, and documentation for integrating it with S&Box once that information is available.

## Project Setup
